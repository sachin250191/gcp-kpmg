# To set up a 3-tier application in GCP with Terraform where the web and application tiers are in GKE and the database tier is in a VM, you can follow these general steps: 

### Define your infrastructure as code using Terraform: Start by defining your infrastructure using Terraform. This includes the GKE cluster, the VM instance for the database, and any other necessary resources like network configurations.

### Create the GKE cluster: Use Terraform to create the GKE cluster, specifying the number of nodes and other relevant details.

### Deploy the application to GKE: Deploy your web and application code to the GKE cluster using Kubernetes manifests. This could involve creating Kubernetes Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

### Create the VM for the database: Use Terraform to create the VM instance for the database. You will need to specify the machine type, disk size, and other relevant details.

### Install and configure the database software: Install the necessary database software (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL) on the VM instance and configure it according to your application's needs.

### Configure the network connectivity: Configure the network connectivity between the GKE cluster and the VM instance so that the application can access the database.
